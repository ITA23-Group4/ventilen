## Branching Strategy

We have chosen to follow GitHub Flow as our branching strategy for our MVP. This entails the following:

![githubflow](https://github.com/ITA23-Group4/ventilen/assets/88247953/c902802c-fb7b-482b-ad5a-356a80428618)

- **main:** Main branch in the project, where the majority of our code is collected.
- **Feature Branches:** Each feature or task we work on is implemented in its own branch, starting from main.
- **Pull Requests (PRs):** When a feature is completed, we open a pull request against main. This allows for review and feedback before the changes are integrated into the main branch.

We chose GitHub Flow over alternatives like GitFlow because we are in the early phase of the project, focusing on developing our MVP. GitHub Flow offers a simple and flexible workflow that fits perfectly with our need for rapid iteration and implementation of new features. By minimizing the number of necessary branches and reducing complexity, GitHub Flow ensures an easier path towards a functional MVP.

To make our branch naming more consistent and comprehensible, we have chosen to follow these prefix conventions:

- **feature/** for new features
- **refactor/** for rewrites
- **doc/** for documentation changes

## Project Strategy

As a starting point, we have practiced pair-programming/co-piloting, where all three of us have worked on the code simultaneously. This allowed us to exchange ideas, solve problems quickly, and ensure a high quality of code. For smaller tasks that needed to be distributed, we have utilized GitHub's Backlog Project functionality set up within our organization.

Here we divide tasks into the following categories:

- **To-Do:** Tasks that have not yet been started.
- **In-Progress:** Tasks that are currently being worked on (with one of us assigned as responsible).
- **Done:** Tasks that are completed and ready for main.

This system helps us organize our work and ensures that we have a clear understanding of what needs to be done, what is in progress, and what is completed.
